In most cases this will be inferred for you as the user fills the form, so you won't need to use it. One of the following:\r\n    - dankort\r\n    - discover\r\n    - mastercard\r\n    - visa\r\n    - amex\r\n\r\n#### Missing features towards the intended goals\r\n\r\n- Images are inlined using base64, [Card](http://github.com/jessepollak/card) uses images created with css.\r\n\r\n#### Planned improvements\r\n\r\n- Allow for some way to indicate that a field is invalid, and style appropriately to indicate errors. \r\n- Add more credit card variations, to the extent that [Payment](http://github.com/jessepollak/card) supports. \r\n- Maybe inline styles according to facebook's new guidelines, for now the styles are in a separate stylesheet.\r\n- Automated test suite.\r\n\r\n#### Intentional deviations\r\n\r\n- There is no intention to port the form or validation part of [Card](http://github.com/jessepollak/card). This is merely for display.\r\n- Flat background colors for the various cards.\r\n- Placeholder symbols are progressively filled while changing the values.\r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\n  - Clone the repo\r\n  - Run npm install\r\n  - Run npm start\r\n  - Use test/index.html for testing behaviour and display\r\n\r\nIt was developed on a local webserver so it doesn't come with any server tools.\r\nIf someone wants to add a more fleshed out build/testing process (gulp/grunt/webpack) it's very much welcome.\r\n\r\nMost of the credit goes to @jessepollak for creating and mantaining [Card](http://github.com/jessepollak/card), I just ported it over.\r\n\r\n",
